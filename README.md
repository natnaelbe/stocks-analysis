#Overview
## The purpose of this analysis is to observe stocks from 2017, 2018, and make an observation of all stocks. We are refactoring code from the modules and seeing how fast it runs
after utilizing code.
#Results
## The stocks for 2017 mainly had positive outcomes with favorable returns, whereas the 2018 stock mainly had a negative outcome with unfavorable returns. The code for 2018 executed at a faster pace compared to the code from the previous year.

#Summary
## An advantage for refactoring code is that you are able to practice what you learned from the modules and apply it to your studies. A disadvantage is that within this refactoring
you are likely going to encounter errors in your code. You would likely have to debug your program several times until you are clear from any errors.
## How the advantages tie into the refactoring is that you are able to rewrite syntax without looking at the completed code from the module. How the disadvantages tie into the
refactoring is that you may be writing code as asked in the challenges but you might be misunderstood by the wording of the code. This will result in an error being thrown. From work-
ing on this project, I forgot to include the "Next i" syntax for my for loop which was one of the reasons my code failed to run. Other instances included my confusion on which 
code applied to which sheet on my excel file. I thought I was only observing my "All Stocks Analysis" file to accomplish this assignment when that was not necessarily the case.
